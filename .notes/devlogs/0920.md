SQL Database Fixes and Test Success

## 💡 Body
This was a quick entry before I did my class for Saturday, I wanted some fixes for the database and the tests as I kind of felt bad I had failed unit tests.
- Started fixing SQL database to make tests better
- Added users table and altered employees table (for auth and tokenization)
- All 24 tests are now working properly! Thank god, QA hell
