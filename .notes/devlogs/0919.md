Development Progress and Refactoring

## 💡 Body
Today, I worked extensively on the SentiNet project, focusing on refining the backend architecture and addressing several bugs. Here are the highlights of the day:

- Accessed a bash terminal inside a Docker container within a GitHub Codespace (cloud environment).
- Successfully resolved an issue where the SQL database was not rendering properly during Docker builds.
- Began transitioning resources and controllers from a Laravel-inspired architecture to a Flask-based one.
- Integrated controllers, resources, blueprints, and other components into the Flask architecture, fixing numerous bugs along the way.
- Added a `tests/` folder and implemented initial unit tests for controller endpoints.
- Reorganized the Python root directory to `/server` by strategically placing `__init__.py` files. This resulted in a cleaner structure, though the `defense/` folder still requires further cleanup.
- Logged test results under the `log/` directory for better traceability.
