Initial configuration and setup.

## üí° Body
Today was day one of setting up and configuring the laboratory for SentiNet, which was inspired by cybersecurity and the concept of cyberwarfare, where there is an attacking side and a defending side. The project also drew inspiration from games such as VALORANT and Clash of Clans, which feature strategic and warfare elements in their gameplay.

SentiNet/Sentinet is a portmanteau of "Sentinel" and "Net." Two nights before this note was made, I decided to create a project like this with the assistance of GPT-5 and Copilot Pro. At first, I was excited by the premise of a small, casual project that I could pause and return to anytime‚Äîsimilar to a Minecraft world from my younger days, but more aligned with my profession, merging two of my greatest loves: work and play.

Thanks to GPT-5, I was able to design a directory structure with a top-level `defense/` folder, an `offense/` folder, and a `.notes/` folder. Afterwards, I added necessary files such as the license, `README.md` (no content yet), `.gitignore`, `.venv`, `.env.example`s and `.env` for my local machine, `docker-compose.yml`, and `Dockerfile`s. Then, I created folders for an employee CRUD system using React/TSX, Flask, and MySQL‚Äîa stack I am familiar with for easy configuration and development.

I did not expect the workload that came with setting up a project like this, especially considering that I would have been lost without the intervention of AI-assisted tools acting as my second (GPT) and third (Copilot) brains. It was surreal to see some of my lessons come to life in a practical way: cybersecurity and information assurance, system administration via Linux, DevOps and version control via GitHub, cloud computing via GitHub Workspaces, AI-assisted development (which is obvious at this point), web systems and technologies (Docker and Flask, since Flask was my first API server library), and systems architecture with the DB+API+Web model.

I'm quite tired after this and may need time to process everything, but it is enjoyable. It reminds me of the time I would play Minecraft and grind a world for growth.
