# Lab Session Tasks â€” September 19, 2025

## Goals for Today

- Build the server further and expand the infrastructure
- Implement OOP for table access (inspired by Laravel's approach)
- Use Python context managers for resource handling
- Get basic CRUD functions going (copy Laravel patterns where useful)
- Focus on defensive coding and structure for future scalability

---

*Notes:*
- Prioritize clean, maintainable code.
- Document any architectural decisions.
- Map offensive/defensive patterns if experimenting with attack simulations.
