# 🌐 SentiNet Laboratory

Welcome to **SentiNet Laboratory** — a general IT-focused learning repository designed to explore and master a wide range of modern technologies and practices. This repository serves as a sandbox for learning, experimentation, and documentation across various domains of IT.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

- **🛡️ defense/**: Focused on **secure software development**. This directory includes several key subfolders:
  - **📂 db/**: Contains SQL scripts for managing database schema versions. These scripts ensure database consistency and security by implementing version control for schema changes.
  - **🖥️ server/**: The core backend implementation, featuring:
    - **🔧 controller/**: Handles business logic and API endpoints for various functionalities like attendance, payroll, and user management.
    - **💾 resource/**: Manages data access and interactions with the database, ensuring secure and efficient data handling.
    - **🐳 Dockerfile**: Provides containerization support for deploying the server in isolated environments.
    - **📜 requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies for the backend application.
  - **🧪 tests/**: Includes unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the system. Organized by modules, such as attendance logs, employees, and payroll.

- **⚔️ offense/**: Contains **educational attack simulations** for lab-only use. Learn about:
  - Common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQLi, XSS) in a controlled environment.
  - How to mitigate these vulnerabilities with defensive coding practices.
  - Simulated attacks paired with their defensive countermeasures.

- **📒 .notes/**: A collection of personal notes, logs, and reflections on:
  - Cybersecurity concepts.
  - System architecture and workflows.
  - General IT knowledge and best practices.
